Tidy Up
=======
+ DONE review todos in code
+ DONE review inspections
+ remove print and add logging instead
+ make paths in db relative 
+ make paths in symlinks relative
+ get rid of 'Original Filename' column in SyncFiles Column (requires duplicate name handling refactor)
+ remove passing of path to Data Model Objects
+ more review of affect of edits of photos
+ handle duplicate names in album links


Cool Stuff
==========
+ upgrade pydrive to Drive API v3
+ review queries in gphotos-sync now we have v3 queries
+ implement my old albums via the description tags
+ also do a 'no-album for each year (or month)'
+ remove gdata dependency (not possible) and make python 3 compatible

Long Term
=========
+ Two way sync of google drive (but not Google Photos - need to be cautious of jpgs in Computers too)
+ change monitoring on Google Drive
+ change monitoring on local filesystem
+ run as a service
+ use Google Photos upload API to put quota free photos up (copy Backup and Sync tool semantics even though they are a bit rubbish)
