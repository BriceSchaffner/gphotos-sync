Do they also get single matches to the correct RemoteId (match on Create and name)?
No they do not, they might have but their RemoteId was overwritten by the loose match.
To fix this need to do staged matching and do the Uid and Filename last on remaining unmatched items.

Cant work out how to get sql lite to do this. Apparently the syntax should be:

UPDATE LocalFiles
set RemoteId = (SELECT RemoteId
                FROM SyncFiles
                WHERE
                (LocalFiles.OriginalFileName == SyncFiles.OrigFileName or
                       LocalFiles.FileName == SyncFiles.FileName)
                  AND (LocalFiles.Uid == SyncFiles.Uid or
                       LocalFiles.CreateDate = SyncFiles.CreateDate)
)
WHERE EXISTS
                (LocalFiles.OriginalFileName == SyncFiles.OrigFileName or
                       LocalFiles.FileName == SyncFiles.FileName)
                  AND (LocalFiles.Uid == SyncFiles.Uid or
                       LocalFiles.CreateDate = SyncFiles.CreateDate)
)
;
;
